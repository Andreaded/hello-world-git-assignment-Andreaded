Version2

Its Dark in Here 
by Shel Silverstein with improvements by Andres Padberg

I am writing these poems
From inside a snake,
And it's rather dark in here.

So please excuse the handwriting
Which may not be too clear.
 
But this afternoon  by the snake's cage
I'm afraid I got too near.

And I'm writing these lines
From inside a snake,
And it's rather dark in here.
