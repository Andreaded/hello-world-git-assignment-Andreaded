Its Dark in Here
by Shel Silverstein

I am writing these TURNIPS
From inside a TURNIP,
And it's rather dark in here.

So please excuse the TURNIP
Which may not be too clear.
 
But this TURNIP by the TURNIP's cage
I'm afraid I got too near.

And I'm writing these TURNIPS
From inside a TURNIP,
And it's rather TURNIP in here.
